# Linear-Statisitcal-Analysis
Statistical analysis on marketing campaigns of a banking institution using R

Linear statistical analysis is implemented to build a logistical regression model for marketing campaigns of a banking institution to predict a term deposti subscription. In the project, stepwise approach is applied to determine the best predictors, such as dropping non significant variables, testing and possibly dropping interactions and quadratic terms. Outliers and influential points are checked, and multicollinearity is checked as well. Cross-validation is used to estimate how accurately the predictive model performs.
